# VALUES TAKEN FROM: https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/blob/main/ur_moveit_config/config/joint_limits.yaml

# These limits are used by MoveIt and augment/override the definitions in ur_description.
#
# While the robot does not inherently have any limits on joint accelerations (only on torques),
# MoveIt needs them for time parametrization. They were chosen conservatively to work in most use
# cases. For specific applications, higher values might lead to better execution performance.
